you have to make a one file python reflex , 
(1)the top row displays two components cstn_name and a select dropdown to show other options of cstn_name which will set cstn_name
(2) the row below that displays all the cfsh_names corresponding to the cstn_name above. And infront of each cfsh_name, there will be a heart icon representing an engine deployed on that cfsh_name.  A cfsh_name has multiple  engines deployed on it , so it will have one heart corresponding to each engine. And when we hover our cursor over the heart , then we will see the name of the engine. Each engine and cfsh_name has a radio group also
(3) The space below the two rows, is divided in three columns.
The first column ,has a search field on the top and  displays all the group_name .Each group has a radio group button
Each group has multiple stacks , second column shows all the stacks of the selected groups.Here  user will select a stack again a radio button.
Third column has a toggle switch at top , so. this column basically has two tabs , each tab display some info. Only one table is switched at a time
(4) there is a side bar also , once a engine's checkbox is selected  or a stack is selected, this sidebar canoe used. it has three dropdown, on top of dropdown , cstn_name , cfsh_name and engine name is written and each drop down opens to show some information regarding the component.

Now all the required data is available in form of dictionary:
(a)There is one dictionary which has mappings one cstn_name to many cfsh_name {cstn_name to all the cfsh_name which are deployed on this cstn_name }
(b)There is one dictionary which has mappings one cfsh_name to many engine {cfsh_name to all the engine which are deployed on this cfsh_name }
(c)There is one dictionary which has mappings one engine to many group_name {engine to all the group_name which are deployed on this engine }
(d)There is one dictionary which has mappings one group_name to many stack_name {group_name to all the stack_name which are deployed on this group_name }
At a time only one cfsh_name can be selected out of all the displayed cfsh_names(radio group)
At a time only one engine can be selected out of all the displayed engines(radio group)
At a time only one group_name can be selected out of all the displayed group_names(radio group)
At a time only one stack_name can be selected out of all the displayed stack_names(radio group)
Rest information you can hardcode, I will change it according to myself. Take your time and implement everything as described
If a engine radio is selected the cfsh_name radio corresponding to it should automatically be selected
If a group_name radio is selected the cfsh_name radio and engine radio corresponding to it should automatically be selected

If nothing is selected then all the group names should be displayed in the first column
If just a cfsh_name is selected and no engine is selected then all the group names deployed on all the engines which are deployed on that cfsh_name should be shown in the first column
If a engine is selected then all the group names deployed on that engine should be shown in the first column

Also there is one more dictinary , which is one to one which tells about status of engine whether an engine is "working" or "stopped"
The "working" engine should be represent as green heart and the "stopped" engine should be represent as red heart in second row. Note that the tooltip hover in second row is really important
